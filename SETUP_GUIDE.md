## Testing Checklist

### Before Going Live:

- [ ] Redis setup complete (test slot locking)
- [ ] Book appointment → verify 60s hold expires
- [ ] Cancel appointment → verify waitlist notification
- [ ] Search with ZIP code → verify distance calculations
- [ ] Book with room requirement → verify atomic transaction
- [ ] Try to double-book → verify conflict detection
- [ ] Check calendar sync → verify token refresh

### Performance Targets:

- Search response time: <500ms (with Redis caching)
- Booking completion: <2 seconds
- Waitlist notification: <30 seconds from cancellation
- 99.9% uptime for slot locking
