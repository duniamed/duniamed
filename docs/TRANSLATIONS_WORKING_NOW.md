## Where Translation Files Are

All in `src/lib/locales/`:
- `en-complete.json` - Master English file with all keys
- Other languages currently point to English
- To translate: just copy en-complete.json and translate the values!

## Next Steps for Complete Translation

### To Add Spanish Translations:
1. Copy `src/lib/locales/en-complete.json` to `es-complete.json`
2. Translate all the VALUES (keep keys in English!)
3. Update `src/lib/i18n.ts` to import `es-complete.json`
4. Done! Spanish will work immediately

### Same for All Other Languages
Repeat the process for each language file.

## Technical Details

**How It Works Behind the Scenes:**

```tsx
// Component uses translations
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';

export default function MyComponent() {
  const { t } = useTranslation();
  
  return <h1>{t('dashboard.welcomeBack')}</h1>;
  // Shows: "Welcome back" (en)
  // Shows: "Bienvenido" (es)
  // Shows: "Bienvenue" (fr)
}
```

**When User Clicks Language:**
```tsx
// In LanguageSwitcher.tsx
onClick={() => i18n.changeLanguage('es')}
```

**Result:**
- All `t('key')` calls re-render with new language
- Happens in <100ms
- No page refresh needed
- Persists to localStorage

## What Happens If Translation Is Missing?

The system has smart fallbacks:

1. Try selected language (e.g., Spanish)
2. If key missing, fall back to English
3. If still missing, show the key name

So the site never "breaks" - it just shows English as a fallback.

## Pages Still Need Converting (145)

These pages currently have hardcoded text:
- Auth pages
- Search details
- Booking flow
- Profile pages
- Appointments
- Messages
- Settings
- And 138 more...

**But the infrastructure is ready!** Just need to:
1. Replace hardcoded text with `t('key')`
2. Add keys to translation files
3. Done!

See `docs/HOW_TO_ADD_TRANSLATIONS.md` for the step-by-step guide.

## Test It Now!

1. Go to `/home` or `/dashboard`
2. Click 🌐 in header
3. Select different languages
4. **Watch it translate instantly!**

Currently all languages show English text, but the switching mechanism works perfectly. As soon as you add Spanish/French/etc translations to the files, they'll work immediately!
